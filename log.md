# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Warmed up with some FCC work. Worked on CSS for ReactTacToe: https://github.com/Synsyxx/Reactactoe

**Thoughts:** CSS is a part I struggle with a little bit, so I will focus a lot on that to improve my design techniques.

### Day 2: January 11th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Started a platform style game in vanilla JavaScript: https://github.com/Synsyxx/stride

**Thoughts:** It was fun doing something a bit different and going back to the basics with JavaScript to reinforce some practices.
