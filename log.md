# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Warmed up with some FCC work. Worked on CSS for ReactTacToe: https://github.com/Synsyxx/Reactactoe

**Thoughts:** CSS is a part I struggle with a little bit, so I will focus a lot on that to improve my design techniques.

### Day 2: January 11th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Started a platform style game in vanilla JavaScript: https://github.com/Synsyxx/stride

**Thoughts:** It was fun doing something a bit different and going back to the basics with JavaScript to reinforce some practices.

### Day 3: January 12th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Got farther in to platformer, almost ready to display on page, will start adding controls soon: https://github.com/Synsyxx/stride

**Thoughts:** While it's a simple game to start, I plan to add more later to see what I can turn it in to!

### Day 4: January 13th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Got farther in to platformer, almost ready to display on page, movements added for actors, working on controls for player
https://github.com/Synsyxx/stride

**Thoughts:** It's fun working on something quite different from web pages and web applications. Will probably start working on a platformer in UE4 soon.

### Day 5: January 14th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Game now displays on webpage properly. Got a few more bugs to work out before it is fully functioning.

**Thoughts:** Need to start blogging/writing out thought processes more to explain the way I do things better in interviews.

### Day 6: January 15th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Game is now functional, at MVP. Will redesign over time possibly.

**Thoughts:** A Twitter post from today really sank in. It simply stated:
"Stop trying to find the right way to do things and just do what works for you."
I've always struggled with just _doing_ the thing. I need to break past that.

### Day 7: January 16th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Today's work got lost in a deep dive in experimenting with MaterialUI and a rabbit hole of reading. I learned quite a bit, but made no git repositories unfortunately.

**Thoughts:**  I believe some days you must set aside for deeper reading and learning to hammer down on new skills, so I will be implementing that in to the 100 Days of Code challenge once a week. These trainings will be used in the following week of work.

### Day 8: January 17th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Spent some time diving back in to an old portfolio design using React and MaterialUI. Will spend this next week building out this portfolio and launching by next week.

**Thoughts:**  I had to correct a few bugs from dependency issues with MaterialUI, which was the original reason I had stopped working on it. Looks like they corrected the issues so I can continue on with this project :)

### Day 9: January 18th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Started messing around with the layout of the NavBar. Removed some things that weren't necessary.

**Thoughts:**  Trying to imagine the purpose of the navbar for my portfolio. May scrap it in favor of some other thoughts. Really want it to reflect me and my personality and skillset moreso than trends in portfolio designs.

### Day 10: January 19th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Probably using very little MaterialUI in the build. We will see. Scrapped the NavBar for a card layout that I thought of. Worked on a wire frame for the plan and going full force through it.

**Thoughts:**  Ran in to a hand full of issues and ended up uploading nonsense, so tomorrow is going to be a busy day.
