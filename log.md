# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Warmed up with some FCC work. Worked on CSS for ReactTacToe: https://github.com/Synsyxx/Reactactoe

**Thoughts:** CSS is a part I struggle with a little bit, so I will focus a lot on that to improve my design techniques.
