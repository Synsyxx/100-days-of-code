# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Warmed up with some FCC work. Worked on CSS for ReactTacToe: https://github.com/Synsyxx/Reactactoe

**Thoughts:** CSS is a part I struggle with a little bit, so I will focus a lot on that to improve my design techniques.

### Day 2: January 11th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Started a platform style game in vanilla JavaScript: https://github.com/Synsyxx/stride

**Thoughts:** It was fun doing something a bit different and going back to the basics with JavaScript to reinforce some practices.

### Day 3: January 12th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Got farther in to platformer, almost ready to display on page, will start adding controls soon: https://github.com/Synsyxx/stride

**Thoughts:** While it's a simple game to start, I plan to add more later to see what I can turn it in to!

### Day 4: January 13th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Got farther in to platformer, almost ready to display on page, movements added for actors, working on controls for player
https://github.com/Synsyxx/stride

**Thoughts:** It's fun working on something quite different from web pages and web applications. Will probably start working on a platformer in UE4 soon.

### Day 5: January 14th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Game now displays on webpage properly. Got a few more bugs to work out before it is fully functioning.

**Thoughts:** Need to start blogging/writing out thought processes more to explain the way I do things better in interviews.

### Day 6: January 15th, 2019

**Today's Progress** Warmed up with some FCC work. Game is now functional, at MVP. Will redesign over time possibly.

**Thoughts:** A Twitter post from today really sank in. It simply stated:
"Stop trying to find the right way to do things and just do what works for you."
I've always struggled with just _doing_ the thing. I need to break past that.
